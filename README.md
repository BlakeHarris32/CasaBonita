# Casa Bonita Booking Finder üåÆüóìÔ∏è

Welcome to the Casa Bonita Booking Finder repository! This bot is your trusty companion for keeping track of new booking dates at the legendary Casa Bonita.

## Why Does This Exist?
When you receive your invite email from Casa Bonita, 9/10 times the date you want has already been booked. They only release a certain amount of dates at a time, and they get booked up rather quickly (especially the good times and seats). Personally, I wanted Cliff Side tickets, but they were always booked whenever I would check. So, I created this app.

## Features üåØ

- **Burrito-Powered Search:** Casa Bonita Booking Finder tirelessly scans for new booking dates, ensuring you stay in the loop.
- **Salsa-fied Notifications:** Receive instant notifications via slack when new dates become available, so you can secure your spot at Casa Bonita without hesitation.

    `git clone git@github.com:ch0chi/casa-bonita-booking-finder.git`
2.  Create .env file  
    `cp .env.example .env`
3.  Create a Slack [webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
4.  Configure the .env parameters

5.  Configure the docker-compose.yaml
    1.  You really only need to change the `network_mode` . I use wireguard to mask my ip, but setting it to `host` will work.
6.  Run the bot
    `docker compose up --build -d`
